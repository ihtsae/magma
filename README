MAGMA README FILE

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Quick start

    Create a make.inc file to indicate your C/C++ compiler, Fortran compiler,
    and where CUDA, CPU BLAS, and LAPACK are installed on your system.
    Examples are given in the make.inc-examples directory for various
    libraries and operating systems. The examples rely on paths such as $CUDADIR
    and $MKLROOT being set in your environment.

    To compile shared and static libraries in lib, and testers in testing and
    sparse/testing:
        make
    or:
        make lib
        make test
        make sparse-lib
        make sparse-test

    To install libraries and headers:
        make install prefix=/usr/local/magma

* Detailed installation instructions and further documentation is provided in
    docs/html/index.html
    or
    http://icl.utk.edu/projectsfiles/magma/doxygen/

* There is also a CMake option, especially useful for building on Windows.
  See README-Windows.

    The MAGMA project supports the package in the sense that reports of
    errors or poor performance will gain immediate attention from the
    developers. Such reports, descriptions of interesting applications,
    and other comments should be posted on the MAGMA user forum.
