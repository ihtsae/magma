# HIP Notes

This document is my collected and organized notes on HIP/ROCm programming, mainly learned during my project porting MAGMA from CUDA to HIP.


## Compiling

To compile, you use `hipcc`, which works the same as most C compilers (and on NVIDIA platforms, it is a macro-layer over `nvcc`)

### Dumping ISA/GPU assembly

I figured out how to dump ISA/GPU assembly from HIP source files. The process is a bit odd (I would like to see AMD introduce a compiler flag similar to `-S` to emit GPU kernels), but it is as follows:

Say we have a file `source.cpp`, which has some GPU kernels in it. Normally, we would compile like so `hipcc $CFLAGS source.cpp -c -fPIC -o source.o`. Normally, to emit assembly, you would run `hipcc $CFLAGS source.cpp -S source.s`

But, `hipcc` handles it differently, you must export an environment variable. And, you cannot control the output. To do this you run:

`KMDUMPISA=1 hipcc $CFLAGS source.cpp -c -fPIC -o source.o`

This command will dump the GCN ISA to files in the local directory (mine were called `dump-gfx900.isa` and some other files too -- just check what files were created).

`KMDUMPLLVM=1 hipcc $CFLAGS source.cpp -c -fPIC -o source.o`

This command will dump the LLVM IR (Intermediate Representation) of the kernels. However, this is less useful for most use cases, because LLVM IR is largely machine independent, so there is no guarantee of which exact instructions will be generated. Therefore, for most HPC tasks, I recommend inspecting the ISA


### Link times

I was noticing extremely long link times (>20 minutes) for creating `libmagma.so`, which consisted of a bunch of object files. This will also affect other projects; it is not specific to MAGMA

The reason is that HIP saves device code linking until that final linking step, which is a very costly operation. NVIDIA, by default, does this per compilation unit.

You can enable it by including `-fno-gpu-rdc` (which forces HIP to finalize the device code per CU).

So, for example: `hipcc $CFLAGS source.cpp -fno-gpu-rdc -c -fPIC -o source.o`

Then, `hipcc $CFLAGS source.o source2.o (other.o ...) $LDFLAGS -o liboutput.so`

While the result would be the same with or without the `-fno-gpu-rdc` flag, without it causes the final compilation step to finalize device code for EVERY `.o`, whereas with the flag, only does it for the `.o` files that `make` regenerates
